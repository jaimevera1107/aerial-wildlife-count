# 🦓 Dense Herd Wildlife Detection

Experimental deep learning project for detecting, counting, and classifying African wildlife species in **dense aerial scenes**.

## 📌 Overview
This repository will host a **reproducible pipeline** to:
- Detect individuals of six species (Buffalo, Elephant, Kob, Topi, Warthog, Waterbuck)
- Handle high-density herds with occlusions and scale variation
- Benchmark against **HerdNet** and aim to improve F1, MAE, and RMSE

## 📊 Status
🚧 **Work in progress**
